| **PCI-DSS v4.0** | Cross-referenced via framework-mappings.json |
| **DISA STIG** | Cross-referenced via framework-mappings.json |

Results are displayed with colour-coded console output and saved to a plain-text report, CSV export, structured JSON, interactive HTML report, and CycloneDX SBOM.

## Key Features

- **Multi-framework auditing** — Assess endpoints against CIS L1, CIS L2, Cyber Essentials, CE+, Entra ID, NCSC, and UK MoD DCC in a single pass
- **Cross-framework compliance mappings** — Map checks to NIST 800-53, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, and DISA STIG via `framework-mappings.json`
- **Custom organisation checks** — Define your own audit rules in `custom-checks.json` without modifying the script
- **Entra ID-aware** — Cloud-managed controls (password policy, lockout, account lifecycle) are contextually adjusted to avoid false FAILs on Entra-joined devices
- **Zero dependencies** — No Microsoft Graph, Azure AD module, or internet connection required; uses `dsregcmd`, registry, WMI/CIM, and local tooling only
- **Vulnerability scanning** — Detects outdated desktop applications with known critical/high CVEs via the [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/) and [CISA KEV](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) databases
- **Browser policy auditing** — Chrome, Firefox, and Edge enterprise policy validation
- **Privilege escalation detection** — Unquoted service paths, writable SYSTEM executables, AlwaysInstallElevated, world-writable PATH directories
- **Certificate store audit** — Expired, self-signed, weak-algorithm, and suspicious root CA detection
- **Driver & firmware security** — Vulnerable driver blocklist, HVCI, unsigned driver detection
- **Network security posture** — DNS-over-HTTPS, SMB signing, LLMNR/NetBIOS/mDNS, VPN client detection
- **Backup & recovery readiness** — Volume Shadow Copy, System Restore, OneDrive KFM, recovery partition checks
- **SBOM export** — CycloneDX 1.5 JSON Software Bill of Materials for supply-chain compliance
- **Fleet auditing** — `Invoke-FleetAudit.ps1` runs audits across multiple hosts via PowerShell Remoting with fleet-level dashboards
- **Scheduled audit with drift detection** — `-Monitor` mode registers a Windows Scheduled Task with automatic regression alerts via Windows Event Log
- **Remediation automation** — `-Remediate` mode with dry-run and apply options for auto-remediable failures
- **Interactive HTML report** — Self-contained HTML file with SVG charts, collapsible sections, sortable/filterable results tables, and print-to-PDF support
- **JSON export** — Structured JSON with metadata, framework scores, section scorecard, compliance verdicts, compliance mappings, and full results for SIEM/GRC integration
- **Delta / trend comparison** — Compare against a previous JSON export to show resolved failures, regressions, new failures, and score changes
- **Remediation guidance** — Failed controls include severity tags and one-line remediation actions from the companion `remediation.json`
- **Severity-weighted scoring** — Critical checks weighted x3, High x2, Medium x1 alongside the standard unweighted score
- **Compliance attestation** — Per-framework pass/fail verdicts against configurable thresholds (e.g. 100% for CE, 90% for CIS)
- **Executive-ready reports** — Risk ratings, Top 5 Risks, Quick Wins, framework score dashboards with progress bars, and section-level scorecards
- **CSV export** — Machine-readable output with compliance mapping columns for SIEM, GRC platforms, and spreadsheet analysis
- **Flexible scope** — Audit all frameworks at once or focus on a single framework with the `-Audit` parameter

## Requirements

| Requirement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| **Operating System** | Windows 10 or 11 (tested on 22H2+) |
| **Join Type** | Entra ID joined, Hybrid joined, or standalone |
| **PowerShell** | Windows PowerShell 5.1 or later |
| **Privileges** | Administrator (enforced via `#Requires -RunAsAdministrator`) |
| **Dependencies** | None — fully self-contained |

## Quick Start

```powershell
# 1. Clone or download the repository
git clone https://github.com/pbassill/win-11-build-audit.git
cd win-11-build-audit

# 2. Run the audit in an elevated PowerShell session
.\audit.ps1
```

The script produces a colour-coded console summary and writes four output files to the user profile directory: `.txt` report, `.csv` export, `.json` structured data, and `.html` interactive report.

## Usage

```powershell
# Full audit across all frameworks (default)
.\audit.ps1
.\audit.ps1 -Audit all

# Single-framework audits
.\audit.ps1 -Audit ce       # Cyber Essentials / CE+ checks only
.\audit.ps1 -Audit cis1     # CIS Level 1 checks only
.\audit.ps1 -Audit cis2     # CIS Level 2 checks only
.\audit.ps1 -Audit ncsc     # NCSC alignment checks only
.\audit.ps1 -Audit entra    # Entra ID / M365 checks only
.\audit.ps1 -Audit dcc2     # UK MoD DCC Level 2 checks only
.\audit.ps1 -Audit dcc3     # UK MoD DCC Level 3 checks only

# Delta / trend comparison against a previous audit
.\audit.ps1 -PreviousReport "C:\audits\DESKTOP-ABC_Audit_2025-01-01.json"

# Schedule recurring audits with drift detection
.\audit.ps1 -Monitor                           # Daily at 06:00
.\audit.ps1 -Monitor -MonitorSchedule Weekly   # Weekly on Mondays at 06:00

# Remediation mode
.\audit.ps1 -Remediate                                              # Dry-run: show what would change
.\audit.ps1 -Remediate -Confirm                                     # Apply all remediable fixes
.\audit.ps1 -Remediate -Confirm -RemediateMinSeverity High          # Only fix High and Critical
.\audit.ps1 -Remediate -Confirm -RemediateMinSeverity Critical      # Only fix Critical
```

### Audit Scope Options

| Option  | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| `all`   | Full audit across all frameworks *(default)* |
| `ce`    | Cyber Essentials / CE+ checks only |
| `cis1`  | CIS Level 1 checks only |
| `cis2`  | CIS Level 2 checks only |
| `ncsc`  | NCSC alignment checks only |
| `entra` | Entra ID / M365 checks only |
| `dcc2`  | UK MoD DCC Level 2 checks only |
| `dcc3`  | UK MoD DCC Level 3 checks only |

> **Tip:** Running without the `-Audit` parameter is equivalent to `-Audit all`.

## macOS Auditor

`audit-macos.sh` is the macOS counterpart to `audit.ps1`. It performs a comparable
local security audit on macOS endpoints using only tools shipped with the operating
system (no external dependencies), and produces the same family of reports:
colour console output plus `.txt`, `.csv`, `.json`, `.html`, and a CycloneDX `.json` SBOM.

It evaluates the device against aligned controls for **CIS macOS Benchmark Level 1 & 2**,
**Cyber Essentials / CE+**, **NCSC**, **MDM / Device Management** posture, and
**UK MoD DCC Level 2 & 3**, applying the same scoring model as the Windows tool
(per-framework scores with thresholds, an overall score, and a severity-weighted score).

The script is **MDM-aware**: when it detects MDM enrolment (Jamf, Microsoft Intune,
Kandji, or generic DEP/MDM), cloud-managed controls are annotated so that centrally
managed settings do not produce misleading failures against local policy baselines.

### Requirements

- macOS (Intel or Apple Silicon)
- Stock `/bin/bash` (the script avoids Bash 4+ features for compatibility)
- Run with `sudo` for full coverage — many checks (firmware password, Remote Login,
  network time, security auditing) require root. Without root the script degrades
  gracefully and marks affected checks as warnings.

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Make the script executable
chmod +x audit-macos.sh

# 2. Run a full audit (recommended with sudo for complete coverage)
sudo ./audit-macos.sh
```

### Usage

```bash
# Full audit across all frameworks (default)
sudo ./audit-macos.sh

# Single-framework audits
sudo ./audit-macos.sh --audit ce      # Cyber Essentials / CE+ only
sudo ./audit-macos.sh --audit cis1    # CIS Level 1 only
sudo ./audit-macos.sh --audit cis2    # CIS Level 2 only
sudo ./audit-macos.sh --audit ncsc    # NCSC alignment only
sudo ./audit-macos.sh --audit mdm     # MDM / Device Management only
sudo ./audit-macos.sh --audit dcc2    # UK MoD DCC Level 2 only
sudo ./audit-macos.sh --audit dcc3    # UK MoD DCC Level 3 only

# Delta / trend comparison against a previous JSON export
sudo ./audit-macos.sh --previous-report ./PriorDevice_Audit_2026-01-01_09-00-00.json
```

### Audit Scope Options (macOS)

| Option  | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| `all`   | Full audit across all frameworks *(default)* |
| `ce`    | Cyber Essentials / CE+ checks only |
| `cis1`  | CIS Level 1 checks only |
| `cis2`  | CIS Level 2 checks only |
| `ncsc`  | NCSC alignment checks only |
| `mdm`   | MDM / Device Management checks only |
| `dcc2`  | UK MoD DCC Level 2 checks only |
| `dcc3`  | UK MoD DCC Level 3 checks only |

> **Note:** On macOS the `entra` scope used by the Windows tool is replaced by `mdm`,
> reflecting the device-management equivalents (Jamf, Intune, Kandji) on Apple platforms.

## Custom Checks

Define organisation-specific audit rules in `custom-checks.json` without modifying `audit.ps1`. The script loads this file automatically at runtime and evaluates each rule as Section 81.

Supported check types:
- **registry** — Validate registry values with operators: `eq`, `ne`, `ge`, `le`, `gt`, `lt`, `exists`, `not_exists`
- **service** — Verify Windows service status and startup type
- **file_exists** — Confirm a file or directory is present
- **file_absent** — Confirm a file or directory does not exist

Example entry:

```json
{
    "id": "C.1",
    "description": "Corporate VPN service must be running",
    "type": "service",
    "framework": "Custom",
    "severity": "High",
    "service_name": "PanGPS",
    "expected_status": "Running",
    "expected_startup": "Automatic",
    "remediation": "Install and enable the GlobalProtect VPN client"
}
```

## Framework Mappings

The companion `framework-mappings.json` file maps existing audit check IDs to controls in additional compliance standards:

| Standard | Example Control |
|----------|----------------|
| NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 | IA-5(1), AC-7, CM-7, SC-7, AU-3 |
| ISO 27001:2022 | A.5.17, A.8.5, A.8.20, A.8.24 |
| PCI-DSS v4.0 | 8.3.4, 1.2.1, 6.3.3, 10.2.1 |
| DISA STIG | V-253265, V-253270, V-253290 |

These mappings appear in the CSV export (ComplianceMappings column) and JSON export (compliance_mappings object per result), enabling compliance evidence generation for any mapped standard.

## Fleet Auditing

The companion `Invoke-FleetAudit.ps1` script runs audits across multiple Windows workstations via PowerShell Remoting:

```powershell
# Audit a list of hosts
.\Invoke-FleetAudit.ps1 -ComputerName "PC01","PC02","PC03"

# Audit hosts from a file
.\Invoke-FleetAudit.ps1 -ComputerListFile ".\hosts.txt"

# With credentials and throttling
.\Invoke-FleetAudit.ps1 -ComputerName "PC01","PC02" -Credential (Get-Credential) -ThrottleLimit 10
```

The fleet audit produces:
- Individual JSON results per host
- Fleet summary JSON with aggregate statistics
- Fleet HTML dashboard with per-host scores, most common failures, and compliance rates

## Vulnerability Database

Section 80 (**Application Patch Currency**) checks installed desktop applications against a companion `known-vulnerabilities.json` file containing known critical and high-severity CVEs. The database is maintained via `Update-KnownVulnerabilities.ps1`, which queries:

- **[NIST NVD API v2.0](https://nvd.nist.gov/)** — CVE severity, affected versions, and minimum safe versions
- **[CISA KEV Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)** — Actively exploited vulnerabilities with remediation deadlines

### Updating the Database

```powershell
# Basic usage (public rate limit: 5 requests / 30 seconds)
.\Update-KnownVulnerabilities.ps1

# With an NVD API key (50 requests / 30 seconds)
.\Update-KnownVulnerabilities.ps1 -NvdApiKey "your-api-key"

# Custom output path
.\Update-KnownVulnerabilities.ps1 -OutputPath "C:\audit\known-vulnerabilities.json"

# Skip KEV catalog lookup (offline environments)
.\Update-KnownVulnerabilities.ps1 -SkipKev
```

> A free NVD API key can be requested at [nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key).

**Merge behaviour:** Existing entries are preserved unless the NVD provides a higher minimum safe version. KEV-flagged vulnerabilities include the CISA remediation due date and ransomware association metadata. During the audit, these are highlighted as **ACTIVELY EXPLOITED** for priority remediation.

## Report Output

### Output Formats

| Format | Filename | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Console** | -- | Colour-coded live results (Green/Red/Yellow/Cyan) |
| **Text report** | `<hostname>_Audit_<timestamp>.txt` | Full audit report with compliance summary |
| **CSV export** | `<hostname>_Audit_<timestamp>.csv` | Machine-readable export with compliance mappings for SIEM / GRC |
| **JSON export** | `<hostname>_Audit_<timestamp>.json` | Structured data with metadata, scores, results, mappings, and remediation |
| **HTML report** | `<hostname>_Audit_<timestamp>.html` | Interactive report with charts, filtering, sorting, and print-to-PDF |
| **SBOM** | `<hostname>_SBOM_<timestamp>.json` | CycloneDX 1.5 Software Bill of Materials |

### Report Sections

1. **Compliance Attestation** — Per-framework pass/fail verdicts against configurable thresholds
2. **Executive Summary** — Overall risk rating, unweighted and severity-weighted compliance scores, Top 5 Risks, Quick Wins
3. **Framework Score Dashboard** — Side-by-side framework scores with SVG doughnut charts and ASCII progress bars
4. **Section Scorecard** — Pass/fail/warn rates for each of the 90 audit sections
5. **Device Context** — Hostname, OS edition, join type, tenant, MDM, TPM, Secure Boot, BIOS/UEFI, IP addresses
6. **Delta Comparison** — Score changes, resolved failures, regressions, and new failures vs. a previous audit (requires `-PreviousReport`)
7. **Priority Remediation** — Failed controls grouped by framework with severity tags and one-line remediation guidance
8. **Warnings Summary** — Warnings grouped by framework for manual review
9. **Per-Framework Detail** — Full PASS / FAIL / WARN listing for each framework
10. **Sections Audited** — All 90 sections grouped into logical categories

### Delta / Trend Comparison

Pass a previous JSON export to see what changed between audits:

```powershell
.\audit.ps1 -PreviousReport "C:\audits\previous.json"
```

The report will include:
- **Overall score delta** with directional arrows
- **Per-framework score changes**
- **Resolved** items (previously failed, now passing)
- **Regressions** (previously passing/warn, now failing)
- **New failures** (checks not present in the previous report)

### Remediation Guidance

The companion `remediation.json` file provides severity ratings and one-line fix instructions for common failures. When a failed check matches an entry in the file, the text report, HTML report, and JSON export all include:
- **Severity** — Critical, High, or Medium
- **Remediation** — GPO path, registry key, or PowerShell command to resolve the failure

Severity ratings also drive the **weighted score** (Critical ×3, High ×2, Medium ×1) shown alongside the standard unweighted score.

- **Enhanced device context** — OS edition and build, last reboot time, TPM version/status, Secure Boot state, BIOS/UEFI vendor, PowerShell/.NET versions, domain/workgroup, IP addresses
- **Executive summary enhancements** — Top 5 Risks (sorted by severity weight), Quick Wins (easy registry/GPO fixes with remediation instructions), framework compliance threshold status
- **Four output formats** — Text (.txt), CSV (.csv), JSON (.json), and HTML (.html) generated on every audit run

### v5.2.0 — Audit Scope Selection

- **`-Audit` parameter** — Select which framework to audit: `all` (default), `ce`, `cis1`, `cis2`, `ncsc`, or `entra`
- Checks outside the selected scope are silently skipped, producing a focused report
- Banner, executive summary, and report header display the selected scope
- Fully backwards compatible — running without `-Audit` performs the full audit

### v5.1.0 — Enhanced Reporting & CSV Export

- **Executive Summary** with risk rating and visual compliance score bar
- **Framework Score Dashboard** with ASCII progress bars and per-framework PASS/FAIL/WARN breakdowns
- **Priority Remediation** section with numbered items grouped by framework
- **Warnings Summary** grouped by framework for manual review
- **CSV export** alongside the text report for SIEM and spreadsheet integration
- **Audit duration** tracked and displayed in the report footer
- Report helper functions (`Write-ReportLine`, `Write-Divider`, `Get-ProgressBar`, `Get-RiskRating`)
